# FunimationFeatures
Chrome Extension that adds convenient features to Funimation's lackluster video player.

## Features
- Keybinds (the real main feature)
  - **F** : toggle fullscreen from anywhere on the page.
  - **left/right arrow** : scrub five seconds
  - **S** : skip 82 seconds (enough to skip a standard 90 second OP/ED and still catch a few seconds of the beginning or end)
  - **space** : play/pause; this was already a thing, but now it works even while the player isn't focused.
  - **up/down** : increase/decrease volume (currently no visual feedback for this)
  - **shift + up/down** : increase/decrease playback speed
  - **shift + 0** : reset playback speed to 100%
  
  - You can now **click** the screen to play/pause and **double click** to toggle fullscreen!
  - Basically, stuff that is standard in literally every video player on earth except for Funimation's.
  
- Dark Mode; Currently not toggleable, only on video pages...
