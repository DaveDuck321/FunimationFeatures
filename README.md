# FunimationFeatures
Chrome Extension that adds convenient features to Funimation's lackluster video player.

## Features
- Keybinds (the real main feature)
  - F : toggle fullscreen from anywhere on the page.
  - left/right arrow : scrub five seconds
  - S : skip 82 seconds (enough to skip a standard 90 second OP/ED and still catch a few seconds of the beginning or end)
  - space : play/pause; this was already a thing, but now it works even while the player isn't focused.
  
  - ctrl + up/down : increase/decrease playback speed
  - ctrl + 0 : reset playback speed to 100%
  
- Dark Mode; Currently not toggleable, only on video pages...
